# Why not just creating a map on...

## [Foursquare](https://foursquare.com)?

Some categories are strange, like the different kind of bars are subcategories of "Nightlife Spot".
What about bars open during the day?

When viewing a *list* (a map), the user can't filter it based on criteria. The only way to implement
this feature would be for us to create a list per popular filter like outdoor bars, indoor
bars/restaurants, indoor restaurants, etc.

We don't have the control over the information provided for each marker, although we know it well.
All we can do is suggest *edits*. Some of them get accepted very quick (like restrooms in the Nest
or no Wi-Fi at BLUB), but some just never will (like BLUB's english name, additional category and
english description).

## [Google My Maps](https://google.com/mymaps)?

Markers can't be filtered based on tags. All you can do is creating separate *layers*. A marker can
only be in one layer, so creating a map with indoor bars, outdoor bars, indoor bars/restaurants and
outdoor bars/clubs becomes a real challenge.

## [Yelp](https://yelp.com)?

*Lists* aren't displayed on a map.

The only available map is the map of what you have bookmarked. Unfortunately the map is just a side
thing, using only 1/10th of your screen on the webapp.

The map view is better on the Android app, however there you can't filter the map. And the map won't
be displayed if your location can't be determined.

## [TripAdvisor](https://tripadvisor.com)?

TripAdvisor is only for businesses. You can't add *any* point of interest you want.
